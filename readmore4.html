      <p class="heading">Pilgrimage sites in India </p>
      <hr>
        <p>You may worship a certain god or follow a certain religion, but when it comes to spirituality, no religion is different. <span class="colour">Spiritualism</span> comes from your soul, and the philosophies of every religion, no matter how different, will all help you reach out to your soul. India is a land of a countless number of religions, and pilgrimage sites are found vastly all across the country.
      </p>
<p>
What better place than here if youâ€™re looking for a spiritual awakening? This is the country of<span class="colour"> extensive culture</span> and <span class="colour">deep religious beliefs</span>. Pilgrimage sites in India are of major importance to to the people of this country, and if you wish to return home with a fresh, awakened self, take a look at the few such pilgrimage sites you should visit.</p>
<p>India is a vast country, with diverse cultures and ancient civilization. There are a number of religious groups residing in India. In India we find the oldest pilgrimage tradition in the whole world. The practice of pilgrimage in India is so deeply embedded in the <span class="colour">cultural psyche</span> and the number of pilgrimage sites is so large that the entire subcontinent may actually be regarded as one grand and continuous sacred place. The earliest sources of information on the matter of sacred space come from the <span class="colour">Rig Veda </span>and the <span class="colour">Atharva Veda</span>. </p>

<p>Following the Vedic period the practice of pilgrimage seems to have become quite common, as is evident from sections of the great epic, the <span class="colour">Mahabharata</span> (350 BC), which mentions more than <span class="colour">300</span> sacred sites spanning the sub-continent. By the time of the Puranas, the number of sacred sites had grown considerably, reflecting both the ongoing assimilation of aboriginal sacred places and the increased importance of pilgrimage as a customary religious practice.
</p> 
<p>
Hindus call the sacred places <span class="colour">tirthas</span> and the action of going on a pilgrimage is called <span class="colour">tirtha-yatra</span>. The word tirtha means river ford, steps to a river, or place of pilgrimage. In Vedic times the word may have concerned only those sacred places associated with water, but by the time of the Mahabharata, <span class="colour">tirtha </span>had come to denote any holy place, be it a lake, mountain, forest, or cave. Tirthas are more than physical locations, however. Pious Hindus believe them to be <span class="colour">spiritual fords</span>, the meeting place of heaven and earth, the locations where one crosses the endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth to reach the shore of liberation.</p>
<h5 class="colour size2">Some of the places are as:-</h5>
