       What makes tourism important and its role significant?
      </p>
      <p>The tourism industry, as part of the service sector,has become an important source of income for many regions and even for entire countries. The <span class="colour">Manila </span>Declaration on World Tourism of 1980 recognized its importance as <span class="colour">"an activity"</span> essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies, and on their international relations.</p>
      <p class="colour">Tourism Importance - The Foundation & Overview.</p>
      <p>
        Importance of tourism arises from the numerous benefits and advantages it brings to any host country. But real importance of tourism comes from its nature and how it is defined & structured. And this is what we will explain here. Tourism contributes towards complete growth and development of a country: one, by bringing numerous economic value & benefits; and, second, helping in build country's brand value, image & identity. Tourism industry goes beyond attractive destinations, to being an important economic growth contributor.
      </p>
      <p>We will talk about and explain how tourism adds economic (<span class="colour">non-economic</span>) value to a country and why does it have so much importance for every country. Why every country looks at tourism not just as attracting tourists but as a platform which supports economic growth and complete development. Why it is now gaining recognition and importance as an indicator towards and a barometer of not just growth & development but also <span class="colour">social-economic</span> factors.
      </p>
<p>
Here we do not just list out points of tourism importance. We want to actually know why tourism is important, for countries, for <span class="colour">economies </span>and for the world. We want to understand the reasons and factors which actually make tourism important. For this we need to understand tourism definition & meaning, and its structure. It is the nature, meaning & composition that makes tourism important and brings all its benefits and advantages.</p>
</p>
<p>
This understanding only will build the basis to know and understand economic value & importance of tourism. We will know how tourism plays such a significant role for countries, economies and its significance for wide scale growth and development. And only then can we truly understand and appreciate tourism's significance and the important role it plays.
</p>
<p>
Hence, we give you 5 key factors which highlight and bring out the tourism importance for a country, for an economy, for growth and development, for the world, and for the society and nature and environment too.</p>
<p>
Tourism is very interesting to understand as we explain later. It is an activity, it is an industry and an important growth driver for a country, its economy and also for its social progress and monitoring. Tourism no doubt brings with it tremendous economic value for a country. It touches and impacts several industries directly and many more indirectly through tourism spend. Tourism is one of the important sources of employment generation and foreign exchange earnings for a country. Due to all this tourism gains much more economic importance for any country.</p>

What is Tourism Industry?
</p>
<p class="colour ">
Tourism Industry Definition - Framework of Tourism's Role & Significance</p>
<p>
We can understand tourism industry from the definition and description of tourism in the above section. We just have to take it forward and put it in perspective of an industry. Tourism is largely a services industry. Interestingly, tourism as an industry has no proper definition as an industry. This is because we cannot properly define tourism as an industry limited by a certain set of related economic activities. It has no predefined boundaries as an industry. And then most of the services consumed by tourists cannot be exclusively termed as being provided specifically for tourists like travel, hotel, food and lodging. So, when we try to define and structure tourism as an industry, we need to consider these limitations or should we rather say that tourism's unrestricted presence across various other industries.</p>
<p>
The best way to describe, structure and define tourism industry is to look it through the definition and explanation of tourism.</p>
<p>
Tourism definition above shows that it is a set of actions or activities i.e. travelling to a place, staying there and further local travelling. On this basis, we can define tourism industry as the consumption or use of all services and products by travelers throughout their tourism oriented travel trip. This is the demand side definition of tourism industry.</p>
<p>
The supply side tourism industry definition will be like: Tourism industry is a group of industries providing services and products for various needs of tourists and travelers on leisure, business and other related tourism characterized travel trips. What the tourists spend on consumption of these services and products becomes the revenues of tourism industry.</p>
<p>
The UNWTO (<span class="colour">The World Tourism Organization of the United Nations</span>) refers it as Tourism Sector which is made of several tourism focused industries that normally offer tourism characteristic products (and services). Taking this forward UNWTO defines <span class="colour">12</span> tourism industries that can be said to be serving the tourists in general. These industries are:</p>
    <ol class="bold">
      <li>Accommodation for visitors</li>
<li>Food and beverage serving activities</li>
<li>Railway passenger transport</li>
<li>Road passenger transport</li>
<li>Water passenger transport</li>
<li>Air passenger transport</li>
<li>Transport equipment rental</li>
<li>Travel agencies and other reservation services activities</li>
<li>Cultural activities</li>
<li>Sports and recreational activities</li>
<li>Retail trade of country-specific tourism characteristic goods</li>
<li>Other country-specific tourism characteristic activities</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Tourism industry is actually a large group of these industries which provide range of products and services aimed at serving tourism and the needs of travelers or visitors. This group or chain also indicates towards and brings us to the value chain of tourism industry.</p>

    <p class="colour bold">Global Importance of Tourism Industry</p>
    <p class="colour">Why Tourism is Important?</p>
    <p>Tourism industry is important for the benefits it brings and due to its role as a commercial activity that creates demand and growth for many more industries. Tourism not only contributes towards more economic activities but also generates more employment, revenues and play a significant role in development.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Travel and tourism generates, directly and indirectly, a large percentage of <span class="colour">GDP</span> and a huge number of jobs in the world-wide economy, which can be expected to continue to grow</li>
      <li>Jobs generated by travel and tourism are spread across the economy - in retail, construction, manufacturing and telecommunications, as well as directly in travel and tourism companies</li>
      <li>Tourism jobs employ a large proportion of women, minorities and young people, are predominantly in small and medium sized companies, and offer good training and transferability</li>
      <li>There are numerous good examples of where travel and tourism is acting as a catalyst for conservation and improvement of the environment and maintenance of local diversity and culture</li>
      <li>As tourism depends to a greater degree than most activities, on a wide range of infrastructure services - airports, air navigation, roads, ports, shops, restaurants, etc, it plays an important part in providing them</li>
      <li>Tourism has a comparative advantage in that its start up and running costs can be low compared to many other forms of industry development.</li>
      <p>Despite all the positive effects of tourism, it will be important to minimise its negative impacts on the environment and host communities whilst maximising the benefits it brings in terms of jobs, wealth and support for local culture and industry, and protection of the built and natural environment.

</p>
    </ul>

    </ol>



    <p class="colour bold">Tourism Value & Benefits - Conclusion
      </p>
      <p>
To strengthen the true role, importance and significance of tourism industry as a whole, we would like to quote Mr. Mutyandasvika, general manager of The Elephant Hills resort as telling The Sunday News of <span class="colour">Zimbabwe</span> in an interview, that hosting conferences and meetings significantly contributed to the hotel revenues but MICE business in general is helping in the branding of that place's destination, employment creation and infrastructure development.</p>
<p>
Tourism brings people from everywhere in the world. It is connecting places with people; places with places; and people with people. This sector brings the developed, growing, developing and emerging economies, all on single platform, thus driving them to become competitive globally and improve on their level of services, at least to be tourism competitive. It can even drive countries to have a stable and sound political environment and also have a more developed society.
</p>
<p>
Tourism brings many benefits, including but not limited to the following few:</p>
<ol class="bold">
<li>Growth and boost in Economic activities</li>
<li>Boost wide scale industry revenues</li>
<li>Infrastructure development</li>
<li>Country's improved brand image</li>
<li>Source of foreign exchange earnings</li>
<li>Source of employment generation</li>
<li>Connectivity and growth to local, regional and even the remotest areas</li>
<li>Global connectivity</li>
<li>Improvement in infrastructure and living standards</li>
<li>Cultural growth</li>
<li>Betterment of society</li>
<li>Introduction of new technologies</li>
</ol>
<p>
Thus travel and tourism can give boost to the economy in terms of consumer spending, job creation and more. For developing and emerging countries tourism can provide a great push to the economy.</p>
<p>
This sector is driving growth in industries, in fact pushing those industries and economies to do better. This uniqueness of <span class="colour">travel and tourism</span> and its impact can be said to be more pronounced in the business travel segment. Thus, tourism as a while and within it MICE or business events are, or could be, a significant factor in developing world-class infrastructure and level of services.</p>
