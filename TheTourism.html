			<hr>





      <p><span class="bold">Tourism</span>, the act and process of spending time away from home in pursuit of recreation, relaxation, and pleasure, while making use of the commercial provision of services. As such, tourism is a product of modern social arrangements, beginning in western Europe in the 17th century, although it has antecedents in Classical antiquity. It is distinguished from exploration in that tourists follow a <span class="colour">“beaten path”</span> benefit from established systems of provision, and, as befits pleasure-seekers, are generally insulated from difficulty, danger, and embarrassment. Tourism, however, overlaps with other activities, interests, and processes, including, for example, <span class="colour">pilgrimage</span>. This gives rise to shared categories, such as <span class="colour">“business tourism”</span>, <span class="colour">“sports tourism”</span>, and <span class="colour">“medical tourism”</span> (international travel undertaken for the purpose of receiving medical care).</p>

<h5 class="colour">The Origins Of Tourism</h5>
      
        <p>
By the early 21st century, international tourism had become one of the world’s most important economic activities, and its impact was becoming increasingly apparent from the <span class="colour">Arctic</span> to <span class="colour">Antarctica</span>. The <span class="colour">history</span> of tourism is therefore of great interest and importance. That history begins long before the coinage of the word tourist at the end of the 18th century. In the Western tradition, organized travel with supporting infrastructure, sightseeing, and an emphasis on essential destinations and experiences can be found in <span class="colour">ancient Greece</span> and <span class="colour">Rome</span>, which can lay claim to the origins of both <span class="colour">“heritage tourism”</span> (aimed at the celebration and appreciation of historic sites of recognized cultural importance) and beach resorts. The <span class="colour">Seven Wonders</span> of the World became tourist sites for Greeks and Romans.</p>


<p>Pilgrimage offers similar antecedents, bringing Eastern civilizations into play. Its religious goals coexist with defined routes, commercial hospitality, and an admixture of curiosity, adventure, and enjoyment among the motives of the participants. Pilgrimage to the earliest <span class="colour">Buddhist</span> sites began more than 2,000 years ago, although it is hard to define a transition from the makeshift privations of small groups of monks to recognizably tourist practices. Pilgrimage to <span class="colour">Mecca</span> is of similar antiquity. The tourist status of the <span class="colour">hajj</span> is problematic given the number of casualties that—even in the 21st century—continued to be suffered on the journey through the desert. The thermal <span class="colour">spa</span> as a tourist destination—regardless of the pilgrimage associations with the site as a holy well or sacred spring—is not necessarily a European invention, despite deriving its English-language label from <span class="colour">Spa</span>, an early resort in what is now Belgium. The oldest Japanese onsen (<span class="colour">hot springs</span>) were catering to bathers from at least the 6th century. Tourism has been a global phenomenon from its origins.

</p>
<p>Modern tourism is an increasingly intensive, commercially organized, business-oriented set of activities whose roots can be found in the industrial and postindustrial West. The aristocratic grand tour of cultural sites in <span class="colour">France</span>, <span class="colour">Germany</span>, and especially Italy—including those associated with Classical Roman tourism—had its roots in the 16th century. It grew rapidly, however, expanding its geographical range to embrace <span class="colour">Alpine</span> scenery during the second half of the 18th century, in the intervals between European wars. (If truth is historically the first casualty of war, tourism is the second, although it may subsequently incorporate pilgrimages to graves and battlefield sites and even, by the late 20th century, to <span class="colour">concentration camps</span>.) </p>

<h5 class="colour">Technology And The Democratization Of International Tourism</h5>

<p>
<span class="colour">Transport </span> innovation was an essential enabler of tourism’s spread and democratization and its ultimate globalization. Beginning in the mid-19th century, the steamship and the <span class="colour">railway</span> brought greater comfort and speed and cheaper travel, in part because fewer overnight and intermediate stops were needed. Above all else, these innovations allowed for reliable time-tabling, essential for those who were tied to the discipline of the calendar if not the clock. The gaps in accessibility to these transport systems were steadily closing in the later 19th century, while the empire of steam was becoming global. Railways promoted domestic as well as international tourism, including short visits to the coast, city, and countryside which might last less than a day but fell clearly into the “tourism” category. Rail travel also made grand tour destinations more widely accessible, reinforcing existing tourism flows while contributing to tensions and clashes between classes and cultures among the tourists. By the late 19th century, steam navigation and railways were opening tourist destinations from <span class="colour">Lapland</span> to <span class="colour">New Zealand</span>, and the latter opened the first dedicated national tourist office in 1901.
</p>
<p>
After <span class="colour">World War II</span>, governments became interested in tourism as an invisible import and as a tool of <span class="colour">diplomacy</span>, but prior to this time international travel agencies took the lead in easing the complexities of tourist journeys. The most famous of these agencies was <span class="colour">Britain’s Thomas Cook</span> and Son organization, whose operations spread from <span class="colour">Europe</span> and the <span class="colour">Middle East</span> across the globe in the late 19th century. The role played by other firms (including the British tour organizers Frame’s and Henry Gaze and Sons) has been less visible to 21st-century observers, not least because these agencies did not preserve their records, but they were equally important. Shipping lines also promoted international tourism from the late 19th century onward. From the Norwegian <span class="colour">fjords</span> to the Caribbean, the <span class="colour">pleasure cruise</span> was already becoming a distinctive tourist experience before <span class="colour">World War I</span>, and transatlantic companies competed for middle-class tourism during the 1920s and ’30s. Between the World Wars, affluent Americans journeyed by air and sea to a variety of destinations in the Caribbean and <span class="colour">Latin America</span>.</p>



<h5 class="colour">Day-Trippers And Domestic Tourism</h5>

<p>
While domestic tourism could be seen as less glamorous and dramatic than international traffic flows, it has been more important to more people over a longer period. From the 1920s the rise of <span class="colour">Florida</span> as a destination for American tourists has been characterized by “snowbirds” from the northern and <span class="colour">Midwestern</span> states traveling a greater distance across the vast expanse of the <span class="colour">United States</span> than many European tourists travel internationally. Key phases in the pioneering development of tourism as a commercial phenomenon in <span class="colour">Britain</span> were driven by domestic demand and local journeys. European wars in the late 18th and early 19th centuries prompted the <span class="colour">“discovery of Britain”</span> and the rise of the <span class="colour">Lake District</span> and <span class="colour">Scottish Highlands</span> as destinations for both the upper classes and the aspiring classes. The railways helped to open the seaside to working-class day-trippers and holidaymakers, especially in the last quarter of the 19th century. By 1914 <span class="colour">Blackpool</span> in <span class="colour">Lancashire</span>, the world’s first working-class seaside resort, had around four million visitors per summer. <span class="colour">Coney Island</span> in Brooklyn, <span class="colour">New York</span>, had more visitors by this time, but most were day-trippers who came from and returned to locations elsewhere in the <span class="colour">New York City</span> area by train the same day. Domestic tourism is less visible in statistical terms and tends to be serviced by regional, local, and small family-run enterprises. The World Tourism Organization, which tries to count tourists globally, is more concerned with the international scene, but across the globe, and perhaps especially in Asia, domestic tourism remains much more important in numerical terms than the international version.</p>
